this minimalist chrome extension reads and writes a localStorage key called `flipping` to manage flipping

```
{
  "FEATURE_NAME": {
    "development":true,
    "production":false,
    "stage":false
  },
  "OTHER_FEATURE_NAME": {
    "development":true,
    "production":false,
    "stage":false
  },
}
```

where `FEATURE_NAME` is the name of a feature, and `stage` is the name of the environment
